This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About
An over-engineered weather app built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and OpenWeatherMap API.
Built following the freeCodeCamp tutorial: [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginner-web-dev-tutorial-build-a-weather-app-with-next-js-typescript/)

Uses many unnecessary features to achieve what could be done with a much simpler approach.

Questionable design choices and over-engineering are intentional.

The task now is to refactor this project to be more maintainable and readable.
